![エビフライトライアングル](http://i.imgur.com/Jjwsc.jpg "サンプル")
A comma-separated values (csv) data sheet is needed to run CLiCKAR. Query table requires gene name (Gene), 
sample name for individual crispant (Sample_name), forward (FWD_primer) 
and reverse (REV_primer) primer sequences with custom barcoded sequence (underlined) 
without Illumina overhang adaptor sequence, full reference sequence of target amplicon 
(Reference_sequence), and protospacer sequence with protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) 
(Protospacer_sequence_plus_PAM) in each amplicon region of on-target sites.
